    <p>Eki Taula is a talented vocalist and pianist from Lee's Summit, MO. He is a family man married to the love of his life, Lori since August of 2003. They have two wonderful children, Mariah (b.1998) and Mosiah (b.2010). Raised in Independence, MO with his large extended family, Eki was heavily influenced by his Samoan Heritage and that Heritage is filled with singing and dancing. Most of his performance experience in his youth was at church and school singing in a group with his brother and cousins acapella, school choir, and accompanying on the piano. After graduating high school at Fort Osage, he didn't perform much and focused on his work in sales and helping provide for his little family. In 2008, he decided to get back into music and started teaching piano and voice lessons. That led him to going back to school to better serve his students. It was then that he discovered a love for Opera. He's been studying under various teachers at the UMKC Conservatory of Music and will graduate with a degree in music in May of 2019. He's been performing constantly since 2016 at different venues from small restaurants to weddings to even sharing the stage with the legendary Barry Manilow. He is a very polished and diverse musician able to sing any genre from country to pop and of course to his favorite, opera.</p>
